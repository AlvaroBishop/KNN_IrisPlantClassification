# Iris Plant Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors
This project focuses on building a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict the class of iris plants based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this project is a well-known Iris dataset, which is commonly used for practicing and demonstrating machine learning classification algorithms.

## Project Overview
Understanding and classifying iris plants based on their features are crucial tasks in botanical studies. This project aims to demonstrate how KNN, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, can be employed for accurate iris plant classification. The model predicts the class of iris plants among three categories: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is a dummy dataset created for practice purposes. It comprises 150 instances, with each class (type of iris plant) having 50 instances. The four features used for classification are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

### Features
- sepalLength: Sepal length in cm
- sepalWidth: Sepal width in cm
- petalLength: Petal length in cm
- petalWidth: Petal width in cm

### Classes
The dataset is divided into three classes representing the class label of iris flowers:

- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolour
- Iris Virginica

### Implementation
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed to classify iris plants based on the provided features. The model calculates the distance between a data point and its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space and assigns the majority class among them to the data point.

### Acknowledgments
The Iris dataset used in this project is commonly attributed to the work of R.A. Fisher and was introduced in his 1936 paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems." The dataset has since become a benchmark in the field of machine learning and is widely used for educational and practice purposes.
